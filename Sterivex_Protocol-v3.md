# Background
This document describes the protocol for extracting environmental DNA from Sterivex filters without storage buffer using the phenol
method.

## Summary

This protocol was designed to process eDNA samples stored on Sterivex filters from marine environments. The filters are stored without a buffer and frozen at -80°C. The use of phenol is considered a rigorous approach to DNA extraction with resulting DNA relatively free from impurities; therefore, this protocol is often used when experimental goals include detection of rare targets such as marine mammals.

## Method description and rationale
This protocol includes cell lysis using a commercially available buffer and proteinase K, DNA extraction via phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and an isopropanol precipitation stage to maximize DNA yield free from impurities. The Sterivex filter housing is broken open, and the filter is removed to expose it to the lysis buffer. Phenol extraction helps separate nucleic acids from other cellular components. After centrifugation, the DNA remains in the aqueous phase, allowing for further isolation and purification.

## Personnel Required

One person with molecular biology experience.

## Safety

**Chloroform** is classified as toxic, a health hazard, and an irritant. Chloroform can be absorbed through the skin, and it can cause severe eye and skin irritation or be harmful if ingested. It is also classified as a possible human carcinogen. **Phenol** is classified as toxic, corrosive, a health hazard, and environmentally damaging. Phenol can cause serious eye burns and skin damage, as well as pose a general risk to aquatic life and environments. It causes very painful burns that can bleach the skin and take a long time to heal. Phenol is a solid that readily deliquesces, which can lead those not familiar with the material to assume droplets are simply water, leading to accidental burns or improper clean up. All steps involving phenol and chloroform should be performed in a fume hood. Users should wear appropriate PPE including nitrile gloves, a lab coat, closed toed shoes, and eye protection. Coat sleeves should extend to the gloves to ensure no skin is exposed. If exposure to the lab coat occurs with solutions containing phenol, remove the coat immediately. In case of skin contact with phenol, wash teh area with polyethylene glycol (PEG) or water. For chloroform exposure, rinse thoroughly with water.  Properly seal tubes and bottles before transport to minimize fume dispersal and splashing. Treat all used solutions as hazardous waste and dispose of them according to laboratory guidelines. 

## Training requirements

Molecular biology training (including, at a minimum, sterile technique, pipetting small volumes, and running a centrifuge) is required to conduct this protocol.

## Time needed to execute the procedure

This protocol requires approximately 6 hours of labor, including 1 hour and 45 minutes for DNA lysis and around 4 hours for extraction and purification. It also includes an overnight incubation step. Users should plan to complete the extraction in 18 hours over two days.

# Protocol Steps

## Day 1: DNA Lysis (1h45 for 12 samples)

1. **Set up the workspace**: 
   - Preheat the incubation oven to 56°C.
   - Disinfect the BioSafety cabinet with DNAzap and ethanol. Leave materials (pipettors, 1.5 mL tubes, tube racks, NOT filters) under UV for at least 15 minutes.

2. **Prepare the samples**: 
   - Remove Sterivex lock and seal the filter outlet with putty and parafilm.
   - Carefully pipette 1.8 mL of ATL lysis buffer, followed by 20 µL of proteinase K and 60 µL of SDS per sample. Depress the pipettor slowly to ensure it enters the cartridge without spilling.

3. **Master Mix Preparation**: 
   
   - Alternatively, prepare a master mix of Proteinase K and SDS for all samples, accounting for pipetting error. For 8 samples, this would consist of 16.2 mL ATL, 180 µL proteinase K, and 540 µL SDS. Add 1880 µL of Master Mix to eac cartridge.

4. **Incubation**: 
	- Vortex thoroughly for 5 minutes, then seal the filter outlet with parafilm to avoid leakage.
   - Incubate the samples overnight at 56°C using the heat shaker. If possible, enable the cartridges to rotate or shake gently.
   
## Day 2: DNA Extraction, Separation, and Purification (~4 hours)

1. **Prepare for extraction**:
   - Expel the lysate into three 2 mL Eppendorf tubes using a 10 mL syringe screwed into the Luer Lok end.
   - Rinse filters with 1 mL of 1X TE buffer and vortex for 2 minutes. Expel the extract equally among the tubes again.

2. **Phenol:Chloroform Extraction**:
   - Under the fume hood, add 166 µL of 3.0 M sodium acetate and 660 µL of ice-cold isopropanol per sample.
   - Incubate at -20°C for at least 1 hour, then centrifuge at 15,000 g for 20 minutes at room temperature.
   - Discard the supernatant carefully and resuspend the pellet in 133 µL of 1X TE buffer.

3. **Incubation**: 
   - Incubate the resuspended samples at 37°C for 30 minutes, then pool the contents into a single tube.

4. **DNA Precipitation**:
   - Add equal volumes of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (P:C:I, 25:24:1) and vortex thoroughly.
   - Centrifuge at maximum speed for 5 minutes at 20°C, then carefully transfer the upper phase to a new tube.

5. **Centrifugation and Washing**:
   - Add an equal volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (C:I, 24:1), vortex, and centrifuge again for 5 minutes.
   - Transfer the upper phase to a new tube, then add 1/10 volume of NaAcetate and 0.6 volume of ice-cold isopropanol. Vortex and incubate at -20°C for 1 hour.
   - Centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C. Carefully remove the supernatant and wash the pellet with 0.5 mL of 70% ice-cold ethanol. Vortex and centrifuge for another 20 minutes at 4°C.
   - Carefully remove the supernatant using a vacuum tip.

6. **Dissolve the DNA**: 
   - Dissolve the dried DNA pellet in 40 µL of 1X TE buffer. Vortex gently.
   - Incubate at 4°C for a few hours or overnight and store the samples at -20°C.

7. **DNA Quantification**:
   - Quantify the DNA using the Qubit Broad Range kit.

## Cleanup
1. Dispose of phenol/chloroform waste into a designated waste bottle.
2. Place gloves and disposable materials into the appropriate lab waste bins.

# Quality Control
- Verify the presence of DNA using PCR and gel electrophoresis.
- Ensure no contamination is present by running appropriate controls (negative controls without template DNA).
